# SLV

#### The Satellite Launch Vehicle or SLV was a small-lift launch vehicle project started in the early 1970s by the Indian Space Research Organization to develop the technology needed to launch satellites. SLV was intended to reach a height of 400 km and carry a payload of 40 kg. The launch in 1979 was a failure and the launch that took place on 18 July, 1980 was a success.

# ASLV

#### The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle or Advanced Satellite Launch Vehicle, also known as **ASLV**, was a Small-lift launch vehicle five-stage solid-fuel rocket developed by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to place 150 kg satellites into LEO. 

#### The **ASLV** made four launches, of which one was **successful**, two failed to achieve orbit, and a third achieved a lower than planned orbit which decayed quickly. Its final & successful flight was on 4 May 1994.

# PSLV

#### The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (**PSLV**) is an expendable medium-lift launch vehicle designed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).

#### As of 7 November 2020 the **PSLV** has made 51 launches, with 48 **successfully** reaching their planned orbits, two outright failures and one partial failure, yielding a **success** rate of 92% (or 94% including the partial failure).

# GSLV Mk-III

#### Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle is an expendable launch system operated by the Indian Space Research Organization. GSLV was used in thirteen launches from 2001 to 2018, with more launches planned. Even though GSLV Mark III shares the name, it is an entirely different launch vehicle.
